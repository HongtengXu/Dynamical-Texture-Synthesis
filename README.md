# Dynamical-Texture-Synthesis
This project contains the demo code of my paper:
* Xu, Hongteng, Hongyuan Zha, and Mark A. Davenport. "[Manifold based dynamic texture synthesis from extremely few samples.](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/html/Xu_Manifold_Based_Dynamic_2014_CVPR_paper.html)" Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2014. 

The code can only be used for academic research. Please cite the paper above for utilizing the code.

## Requirements and installation
The dijstra's shortest path algorithm from [Piotr's Image&Video Toolbox](https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/) is required.
